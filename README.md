## Scripts related to differential alternative splicing analyses (DAS) and equality-based alternative splicing detection.

#### differential_splicing_arsenal.R
This script performs statistical analyses to test differential splicing. The input consists of counts of alternatively mapped and constitutively mapped reads, the Pr(alt) analgous to PSI. Previous iterations involved fitting PSI values directly to a beta regression but this has since been deprecated.

Direct PSI-value compatibility will reintroduced in an upcoming version.

#### WIP:
Contains old version of AS conservation analyses for the sake of posterity.
